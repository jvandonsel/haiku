A simple random haiku generator in Clojure.

The default vocabulary is very techy, but it can be customized fairly easily.

Some sample haiku:

>The family stops  
>The child breaks a finger  
>Robots recover


>A poem watches  
>A robot lifts some green things  
>All noisy cats die


>A manager blinks  
>Videos await the Web  
>A naked man drifts


>Cold customers jump  
>All batteries hate their path  
>The laden code howls


>Obstructions rotate  
>A leaf notices a cell  
>An image dances
